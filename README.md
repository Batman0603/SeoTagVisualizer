## 🌐 What is an SEO Analyzer?
An **SEO Analyzer** is a tool that scans websites and tells you how well they are optimized for search engines like Google.

It checks things like:
- ✅ Title tags, meta descriptions
- ✅ Heading structure (H1, H2, etc.)
- ✅ Image alt texts
- ✅ Link health and more

In short, it helps you make your website more **visible and discoverable** on the web.

## ✨ What is vibe coding?
> 🧘 **Vibe coding** is my personal style of coding —  
hopping into Replit, writing code freely, experimenting, testing instantly, and enjoying the creative process **without overthinking or over-planning**.

This project is a direct product of that spontaneous, exploratory vibe.  
It’s all about letting ideas flow naturally while coding!

## 🛠️ How I built this project (using Replit for vibe coding)
✅ Started a **Flask Python repl** on [Replit](https://replit.com/)  
✅ Set up folders:

/templates -> HTML files (index.html, results.html)
/static -> CSS & JavaScript

- ✅ Wrote `app.py` for Flask routes and the server logic
- ✅ Added `seo_analyzer.py` to parse HTML and extract tags like titles, descriptions, and headings
- ✅ Installed packages: Flask, BeautifulSoup4, Requests, etc. 
- ✅ Tested everything instantly using Replit’s web preview
- ✅ Once working perfectly, pushed to GitHub and deployed on **Render.com** for a live URL
